# Web translators Zotero
These are the web translators I’ve written for Zotero.

## Lagen.nu
[Lagen.nu](https://lagen.nu) is a website cataloguing Swedish statutes and government ordinances in the Swedish Code of Statutes (Svensk författningssamling, SFS) and court cases from a number of appellate courts as well as the Swedish final courts.
